Unity Developer with over 2 years of experience in developing games for mobile, PC, and consoles. I specialize in gameplay optimization, project architecture, and SDK integration, including analytics, advertising, and monetization. I have worked in teams of 2 to 20 people, successfully managed smaller teams, and mentored junior developers. 
I have experience in creating games from scratch in various genres, including mid-core, hyper-casual, and shooters. I am proficient in modern Unity tools such as DOTS and ECS, and I am passionate about integrating AI/ML into gameplay by exploring advanced Unity technologies. I actively share my experience through technical articles and constantly follow industry trends.
